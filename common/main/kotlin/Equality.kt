/**
 * A zero-overhead equals builder for efficiently calculating object equality.
 *
 * This builder is a value class designed to compare objects for equality with no additional memory
 * overhead. All of its functions are inlined, allowing it to completely replace manual equality
 * comparison without any performance penalty.
 *
 * The equality comparison is performed using a series of checks that evaluate the equality of
 * the object's components. If any of the components are not equal, the comparison short-circuits
 * and returns `false`. If all components are equal, the comparison returns `true`.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```
 * class Person(val name: String, val age: Int) {
 *   override fun equals(other: Any?): Boolean {
 *     if (this === other) return true
 *     if (other !is Method<*, *>) return false // Or use `EqualsBuilder.withClass(this, other)`
 *     return EqualsBuilder
 *       .with(name, it.name)
 *       .with(age, it.age)
 *       .build()
 *   }
 *
 *   ...
 * }
 * ```
